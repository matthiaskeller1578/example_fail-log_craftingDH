## Week 5 Fail Log


### Fail One
My first fail of the week started when I attempted to use Gephi. I had downloaded it to do the first exercise, but every time I tried to open it, it told me that I did not have Java downloaded.... I hate java.... I went into the properties and settings of my java to see why this was not working, as I had just updated it the week before. So I decided to delte java and reinstall it on my computer.... again no luck!! Still when I attempted to use Gephi I got an error code Java 1.8 not downloaded. This is probably one of the most irrortaing errors I received and struggled with in this course. I reached out to my class mate on slack maggie for help. She said that she had not received that error code and suggested I look it up. To my surprise, a lot of others experience the same error code on [github](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1787), and I read though what others did to fix it (The workaround) and then it finally worked. Took me a few hours but I managed. THat reminds me I need to post a link to the help I found for others on slack!

### Fail Two
My second big fail this week was that I had started this module earlier in the week and when I came back to it I forgot that we only needed to do two exercises, so I ended up doing more than I needed, but that is okay as I learned more skills!

### Fail Three


### Fail Four
