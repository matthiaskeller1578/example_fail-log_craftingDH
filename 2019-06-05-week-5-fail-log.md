## Week 5 Fail Log
This week has been good, a lot of what I have failed at, has allowed me to improve. I learned some valuable commands in exercises 8 and 10 which I hope to add to my capstone. 

### Fail One
My first fail of the week started when I attempted to use Gephi. I had downloaded it to do the first exercise, but every time I tried to open it, it told me that I did not have Java downloaded.... I hate java.... I went into the properties and settings of my java to see why this was not working, as I had just updated it the week before. So I decided to delte java and reinstall it on my computer.... again no luck!! Still when I attempted to use Gephi I got an error code Java 1.8 not downloaded. This is probably one of the most irrortaing errors I received and struggled with in this course. I reached out to my class mate on slack maggie for help. She said that she had not received that error code and suggested I look it up. To my surprise, a lot of others experience the same error code on [github](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1787), and I read though what others did to fix it via a workaround. Yet still it did not work. There are a few differnt suggestions to try and make it work, but I think the update that it needs is still too new. I spent about 2-3 hours trying to make it work with little success. That reminds me I need to post a link to the help I found for others on slack!

### Fail Two
My second big fail this week was that I had started this module earlier in the week, and did not come back to it until later, and when I came back to it I forgot that we only needed to do two exercises. Therefore I ended up doing more than I needed, but that is okay as I learned more skills! I would not necessarily consider this a fail, but rather a bit of both fail and success as I ended up developing my skill set, and knowledge which can only help me further with my capstone project! I have already started a bit of my capstone project, and after doing exercise 8, I hope to go back and maybe get a historical map for each location in Canada (atomic hisotry capstone) and add a map with metadata!

### Fail Three
Another fail I had was when I attempted to import a map to Palladio. This is a fail, but also a bit of a goof up. I had not copied the proper tiles url when I was putting my map into palladio at the begining, and I was unsure why it was not work. It took me a few minutes to go back and see where I messed up, but I soon realized that when I copied the URL/ tiles that I had not copied the full length of it. Just goes to show you that one little letter or command can change the whole thing. That just reminds me that when working on editing my capstone, that I must ensure that everything is done correctly. When I was working on my capstone this week I also realized that the BC file was missing, which is why the website was unable to ind the location. Once I added the file location in the capstone, the system was able to find the right page. Cool how something which is missing changes a whole entire set up. This is a reminder for me, that when working on my capstone, to ensure that I copy the full tiles/ url!

### Fail Four
