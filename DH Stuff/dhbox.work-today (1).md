I searched the CWGC (Commonwealth War Graves Commission) for my last name- Keller to find graves of people who served in the war. This system seaches tones
of records which might link to a document with similar spelling

When I searched the Hieldelberg database I found some intersteing things which relate to the word August. ALthough the document does not spell "August" it 
is connected. This shows hw digitalizing documents helps with language barriers.

I will store this information on Github
