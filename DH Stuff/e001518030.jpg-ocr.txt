APPENDIX 1. WAR DIARY. NO.10 CANADIAN STATIONARY HOSPITAL Author:- Sgt. V. A. James.

Western University oF London, Ontario, between September, 1914 and March, 1916, made several offers to the Canadian Government to organize a complete Hospitel Unit for Overseas Service. To these offers the Canadian Government replied thet the War Office deemed they had at the time sufÔ¨Åcient units of thet nature.
It was considered by the Board of Gorvernors that Western University was in a perculiarly advantageous position to suppply a Hospital Unit. A large number of its students in Medicine and other branches were anxious to enlist; many of its graduates, practising phsicians and surgeons, had expressed their willingness to procees Overseas as Medical Officers, and a number of graduate Nurses of London Hospitals, who were associated with the University, desired to serve as Nursing Sisters. The buildings and grounds of the University were available as a training centre during the summer months. It was anticipated that the proposed Unit could be very rapidly recruited and trained ready for Overseas.
Accordingly further urgent representations were made to Ottawa in March 1916. with the result that authority was received to mobilize the Western University Hospital, officially known No.10 Stationary Hospital, C.E.F.
Edwin Seaborn, M.D., a graduate of the University and long associated with its School of Medicine and Surgery, was nominated by the Board of Governers as Officer Commanding the Unit, and in due course the appointment was approved by Militia Headquarters, Ottawa.
