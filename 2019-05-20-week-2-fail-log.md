# Week 2 Fail log
The second week of class has definitely been harder than first week. I struggled with a lot of the exercises, but I have to admit I am actually enjoying this class. I enjoy being challenged, and as well surprisingly failing as well. I have found it enjoyable t run int problem and think of other ways which are outside the box to solve the issues that arise, I have not necessarily had to do this with other classes. Nonetheless, the course has been difficult and stressful at times. 
## Fail 1
The first fail that I encountered this week is with what system to download my commands to. I was confused at first about what program I should use but ended up picking Notepad ++. I was unaware of why we needed to really download the program, and half way through the exercise I got stuck and realized that the program removes all hidden code that microsoft and other programs would add. It is very useful.

## Fail 2
My second fail is a lot worse than my first fail. While completing the fourth component of this weeks exercise I got really stuck with commiting and merging my work. At first my computer refused to allow me to merge my work, and therefore I was stuck at a cross road. I am still not sure why it would not let me. So what I did is delete all the files that I crated and started from scratch. However, now that I started from scratch when I got to comitting my work, the command was not accepted. This really frusterated me. I have message Dr. Graham about this. I am stll going to attempt to retry from scratch again. 

## Fail 3
My third fail is in relation to exercise 1, 2, and 3. While working on these exercises I had taken a break from them, to come back later, and because my computer timed out, I lost the connection to the VPN and as well to DHbox. I then had to redo all three exercises. A good thing about this though is that I got a better commnand of the system. I feel more comfortable now with my abiities now that I had to do this. 

### Annotations
My first annotation that I was to mention which I found to be of great importance to what we learned this week is the markdown [cheat sheet](https://hyp.is/DX0Ouni3Eem8fJN4g5zeRw/github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). I highlighted and annotated this as I belive that this will be very important moving forward. The command keys are the basic foundations of the course.

The second annotation is for the [DHbox link](https://hyp.is/FAmHcnjVEem8l7tujkpj2w/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/) I did not realize at first that there was a differnece for VPN and on campus students. I was stuggeling to loging in at first and was unable to figure out why I could not get in. I annotated this to help inform and remind other students as well as my self that there is a difference

My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/g4mf9Hi0EemM6ENXxrZ-8g/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Open-Access-Research/) refers to the ability of researchers to communicate and work together on projects. I was reading about how it is becoming easier for researchers to share notes and information, which I belive is really important and great. I annotated it, because I belive that the digital software will allow us to share and gain more knowledge globaly.
