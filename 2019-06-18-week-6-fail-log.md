### Week 6 Fail Log
This week I am finishing up my digital history course, by completing my final capstone project!
I am working on a combined project with Maggie Sherwin and Ruzbeh Irani where we are fixing the atomic history project that Sebastian Mol made. 
#### Trail, BC
One of the first things that I stuggled with, was figuring out why the Trail, BC file was not linking with the rest of the assignment. In order to fix this I went through the files that Mol created, and I found that there was a command lacking which allows for the BC file to be linked. Once I found the name and location of the BC trail file, I was able to link it with the rest of the assignment. 

Once linked, I soon found out why the BC file was not linked, which is because the information on it has nothing to do with atomic history. Therefore I did research on the loaction and add it to the file. I pulled new research from new sources which I added to the assignment. I also noticed that the formating of the references were not done properly so I workered a bit on figuring out how to do this. I figuered out where the link to the reference was kept, and moved this to where the title of the article is so that way the person who is using the website can click on the title rather than the publisher. 

I also wanted to italicize the title of the sources, and I was not sure how this might work along side the link. So what I did, was to try using both and merging it with the original file to see if the changeds were changed to the website. Luckly I did it right and it worked on the first try!

Another thing I wanted to do to improve the website, was to change the picture so that there was a diagram which shows how heavy water is used, adn produced. For this I had to first upload the picture file to the project on github, and then I was able to grab the location of the picture. Once I had the location I could upload the pictures location to the BC site, and link it to the presnetation. 

One of the last things I did to the trail, BC page was to change the tilte size from h4 to h3. The reason why I did this, was because all of the subheadings were the same size as the title. I felt like this did not look good, so what I did was make the sub-headings smaller.
