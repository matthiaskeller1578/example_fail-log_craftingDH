### Week 6 Fail Log
This week I am finishing up my digital history course, by completing my final capstone project!
I am working on a combined project with Maggie Sherwin and Ruzbeh Irani where we are fixing the atomic history project that Sebastian Mol made. 

One of the first things that I stuggled with, was figuring out why the Trial, BC file was not linking with the rest of the assignment. In order to fix this I went through the files that Mol created, adn I found that there was a command lacking which allows for the BC file to be linked. Once I found the name and location of the BC trail file, I was able to link it with the rest of the assignment. Once I linked the BC file, I soon found out why it was not linked, which is because the information on it has nothing to do with atomic history. Therefore I did research on the loaction and add it to the file, as well as pictures. I also reorganized the information so that it makes sense and links with the rest of the other locations
