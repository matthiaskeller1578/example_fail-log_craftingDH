This week has been a bit hard, I will admit. Wrangling Data is no easy thing to do. At times I found it to be more and more challenging. Taking a break throughout has made it easier to come back to and looking it over to see where and when I might have messed up. 


### Fail One
A fail that I came across this week pertains to the implementing a comand. while working Step Three: Transforming into CSV format. I had not realized, but when putting in the command, i had forgot a / before the g. I was not sure why DHbox did not accept my command. I had tried putting in the command a second time, but still it did not work. I had originally thought that I might had messed up an earlier part of the exercise. What I did to overcome this set back, and something I will try later if I face a similar challenge, is take a picture of the command entered on the video tutorial with my phone, and then compare the picture to my command. I had first wrote down the command on a piece of paper prior to entering it on DHbox, and I had realized that I forgot to include a / in the command. This helped me identify where I messed up, and allowed me to solve the problem and move forward.

### Fail Two
My second fail came about during my [cleaing up of data](https://hyp.is/7IZb0oYpEemMdM-_SPaBJw/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/supporting%20materials/regexex/). What I messed up was the removing of excess data. When I downloaded my results to excel I soon realized that I forgot to clean up the data for three seperate cases. What I did, rather than go back to the .txt original, was to manualy edit the excel document. I went through the excel document, cleaned up all that I missed, and then re-uploaded the cleaned excel version to my DHbox.- this fail relates to what Dr.Graham mentioned about this class. "There is not one way of doing things in digital humanites". This is a valuable lesson as it not only relates to the "digital sphere" where another individual might have gone about it another way, but as well it can relate to other situations in life. I met Dr. Graham today during his office hours to discuss this and he used a good anology of baking, he said if you are missing an ingrediant you can subsitute it for something else. 

### Fail Three
