## Week 3 Fail log
This week has been a bit of a stuggle, but i sat down, put the effort in, thought things through and got it all working. I am very proud of what I mangaged to accomplish this week, I defenitly feel as though I have improved. 

### Fail 1
My first fail that I encountered this week pertains to the tutorial by Ian Milligan. I had started to worry as my computer took 18 minutes to download the pages from the history webpage. < https://hyp.is/eAPnXoDwEemZ8iNoAnVvXg/programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget> I began to worry because I thought that I might have downloaded the whole entire web page by accident. SO what I did was go back to check to make sure that I put in the right command, which I did. I gave my omputer time, and fianlly put a post on Slack, but just as I posted my computer finished downloading

### Fail 2
My second fail came about when I was attempting to put my TEI exercise on firefox. I was not sure why it was not showing online, and started removing sentences to see where I went wrong. I soon figured out that what I did wrong was I put </P> at the beginning of the paragrph instead of <P>. I then had to go through and fix it all.
