# Week 1 fail log
I had a difficult time my first week setting up all of programs. I was confused at first as the course was not done through CuLearn, which stressed me out, but as I followed the instructions, and watched the videos I started to get the hang of it. ALthough at times I still need to take a break and come back with a clear mind to rethink how it all works.    

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/dTBuvnLPEemAfWuhx_o6qg/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was about the VPN. At first I attempted to install of the add ons through chrome, which is not my primarly browser as I wanted to dedicate this course to that browser but I immediatly had difficulty. Everytime I opened up the VPN page to down load it would open in a blank new tab. I tried to restart my computer but none of this worked, and I even tried to set it up manually through my computer's settings. Therefore I called Carleton's IT support who suggested that I try another browser to download the VPN which can still be utilized on my Chrome browser.

This difficulty taught me that I need to learn to think through the process and most importantly if I find myself in trouble with a step there are other resources I can reach out to.  

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation](https://hyp.is/JDXa0HLPEemiBXe8GBvFcg/github.com/shawngraham/example-faillog-hist3814) refers to my stuggle with understanding what this course is about and what is expected of me. I do not consider myself to be a "tech savy" person, and I started to worry when I read the course manual. When I saw the Indiana Jones example of having the sofware create a script I began to worry if I will succeed in this course. However when I remebered that this course is designed for us to fail in order for us to improve I realized that it is what I want. I originially signed up for this course to learn new skills, and leanring that this course is designed for me to improve my skills taught me that I am in the right course. 

Through seeing what the cousre is expecting of me, I have learned that I will need to allocate my time wisely to complete the assignments and moduels. Most importantly, leaving enough time for me to leave and come back to a challenge that I face. 

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/TYENanLKEemLYPMCVFiYfQ/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) refers to writing my fail logs. While reading about the fail logs, I was unsure of what they were. Once I saw the video on writing the fail log, I had difficulty (right now) figuring out how to re-configure the text and add links and headings.

I am currently taking this time to "mess around" so to speak with figuring out the configuration and how to reshape my text for later on.

## Comments/Concerns

I hope to develop new skills in regard to programing and software as I will be starting my masters in September for public innovation and eGovernance in Europe, and I hope to have a basic background in programing before starting. 

I am concerned about having enough time to complete all of the modules as I have two other courses, and this course seems challenging, but I belive if I work hard and focus I can achieve it!

## About The Course
I enrolled in this course to develop my software skills as I will be attending the University of Leuven, Munster, and Tallinn in September for a Master of Science in Public Sector Innovation and eGovernance. The skills I hope to gain from this course, I hope to be able to use in Masters program which is about digital government. My level of comfort with digital tech is very limited, as I have never taken any technology courses before, however, I am hard working and dedicated to learning from this course. I am very interested in history which focuses on Europe, particularly Germany. What I hope to get out of this course, is some relevent tech skills which I can bring with me to Europe.
